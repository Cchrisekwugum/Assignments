**STEPS TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM**
 - To solve the problem as stated in the documentation.
 I intend to use 4 approaches of versioning
  - version1 : A simple authentication code using a simple dictionary of list to store users data
  - version2 : This uses json file to store all users data with all pass word in plane text
  - version3 : This also uses json file with a users data encrypted
  - version4 : This used fast api to create endpoints and swagger UI to display and test it
